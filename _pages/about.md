Greetings! I’m Yingze Yan, a civil engineer, currently on the hunt for PhD positions where I can continue to blur the lines between AI and concrete jungles!

I am freshly minted with an MSc in Civil Engineering from [ETH Zürich](https://baug.ethz.ch/en/), where my thesis delved into using artificial intelligence for early-stage fault detection in actuators in real world industrial context (seemingly more aligned with machines than buildings!). 

Selecting this topic stemmed from my keen interest in quality control within the realms of architecture and product manufacturing. In the context of architecture, obtaining long-term real-world monitoring data within a limited timeframe poses a significant challenge. However, through collaboration with [Johnson Electric]( https://www.johnsonelectric.com/en), who generously provided comprehensive testing datasets for their new actuators, I was able to develop an efficient real-time quality inspection framework for them within the constraints of my thesis timeline. 

The applicability of my research framework extends beyond civil engineering to encompass mechanical, architectural, medical, and various other fields. While my expertise lies predominantly in civil engineering, I remain open to exploring opportunities in other domains for a PhD position. After all, versatility often leads to unexpected and enriching discoveries.
