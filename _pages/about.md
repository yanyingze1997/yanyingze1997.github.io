Greetings! I’m Yingze Yan, a civil engineer, Currently on the hunt for PhD positions where I can continue to blur the lines between AI and concrete jungles!

I am freshly minted with an MSc in Civil Engineering from ETH, where my thesis delved into using artificial intelligence for early-stage fault detection in actuators in real world industrial context(seemingly more aligned with machines than buildings!).
